Binary-Search-Tree stages of the sequence [7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2]:

Root is 7

The first element, 7, becomes the root.
5 is inserted to the left of 7

5 is less than 7, so it goes to the left of 7.
1 is inserted to the left of 5

1 is less than 7 and also less than 5, so it goes to the left of 5.
8 is inserted to the right of 7

8 is greater than 7, so it goes to the right of 7.
3 is inserted to the right of 1

3 is less than 7, less than 5, but greater than 1, so it goes to the right of 1.
6 is inserted to the right of 5

6 is less than 7 but greater than 5, so it goes to the right of 5.
0 is inserted to the left of 1

0 is less than 7, less than 5, and less than 1, so it goes to the left of 1.
9 is inserted to the right of 8

9 is greater than 7 and greater than 8, so it goes to the right of 8.
4 is inserted to the right of 3

4 is less than 7, less than 5, greater than 1, and greater than 3, so it goes to the right of 3.
2 is inserted to the left of 3

2 is less than 7, less than 5, greater than 1, but less than 3, so it goes to the left of 3.
